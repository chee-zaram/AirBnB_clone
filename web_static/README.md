# Web Static

This directory contains all the necessary files, in [HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/)
and [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html), and `.png` files,
which help to create a static web page to allow users interact with the backend
from an internet browser.

The project happened in stages and built up to the most relevant [index.html]() file.
The [styles]() directory contains all `CSS` files with the most relevant being the
[common.css](), [header.css](), [footer.css](), [filter.css](), and [places.css]().

Contained within the [images]() directory are all logos used.
