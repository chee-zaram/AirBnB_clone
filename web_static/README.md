# Web Static

This directory contains all the necessary files, in [HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/)
and [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html), and `.png` files,
which help to create a static web page to allow users interact with the backend
from an internet browser.

The project happened in stages and built up to the most relevant [index.html](https://github.com/chee-zaram/AirBnB_clone/blob/main/web_static/8-index.html) file.
The [styles](https://github.com/chee-zaram/AirBnB_clone/tree/main/web_static/styles) directory contains all `CSS` files with the most relevant being the
[common.css](https://github.com/chee-zaram/AirBnB_clone/blob/main/web_static/styles/4-common.css), [header.css](https://github.com/chee-zaram/AirBnB_clone/blob/main/web_static/styles/3-header.css), [footer.css](https://github.com/chee-zaram/AirBnB_clone/blob/main/web_static/styles/3-footer.css), [filter.css](https://github.com/chee-zaram/AirBnB_clone/blob/main/web_static/styles/6-filters.css), and [places.css](https://github.com/chee-zaram/AirBnB_clone/blob/main/web_static/styles/8-places.css).

Contained within the [images](https://github.com/chee-zaram/AirBnB_clone/tree/main/web_static/images) directory are all logos used.
